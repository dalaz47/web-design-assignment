The website i have developed is on the MMU Library. 
It explains the different reading materials found in the library. 
This includes the materials that are available for borrowing and those that just have to be utilised inside the library For the borrowing materials 
I created a form for students to fill before borrowing them The form includes the student's name, admission number and course among others 
In the login file I used javascript such that after writing your name and admission number you will get a thankyou message.
